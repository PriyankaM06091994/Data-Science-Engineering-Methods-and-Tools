### Prediction Analysis of Interest Rate Using Machine Learning 
1. Performed data cleansing and data preprocessing on the raw data to make it suitable for modeling and prediction
2. Applied Machine Learning algorithms using classification and regression techniques to provide the best model 
3. Calculated MAPE and predicted the most optimized model that is Random Forest with the least MAPE value of 3.80
4. Automated data visualization dashboards on Tableau and Power BI capturing loan and interest rate predictions
