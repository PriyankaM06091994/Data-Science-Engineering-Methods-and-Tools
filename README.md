### Prediction Analysis of Interest Rate Using Machine Learning 
•	Performed data cleansing and data preprocessing on the raw data to make it suitable for modeling and prediction
•	Applied Machine Learning algorithms using classification and regression techniques to provide the best model 
•	Calculated MAPE and predicted the most optimized model that is Random Forest with the least MAPE value of 3.80
•	Automated data visualization dashboards on Tableau and Power BI capturing loan and interest rate predictions
